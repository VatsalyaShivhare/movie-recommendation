Overview

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using machine learning techniques. It processes a dataset of movies and user preferences to generate personalized recommendations.

Features

Content-based and collaborative filtering

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Interactive recommendation system

Files

dataset.csv: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the recommendation system.

movie recommendation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of the recommendation system.

Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage

Open movie recommendation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run each cell to process the dataset, train models, and generate recommendations.

Modify parameters as needed to test different configurations.

Results

The system provides a ranked list of recommended movies based on user preferences and historical data.

Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning-based recommendations.

Integrate with a web application for a user-friendly interface.

Enhance collaborative filtering with hybrid approaches.
